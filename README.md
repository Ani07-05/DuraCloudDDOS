# DDoS Attack Detection & Mitigation Dashboard

### Overview
This project is a **proof of concept** dashboard that simulates DDoS attack detection and mitigation. It showcases how an automated system can monitor network traffic, detect unusual activity, and apply mitigation measures in real-time.

### Features
- **Simulated Traffic Monitoring**: Displays metrics such as request count, anomaly score, and response time.
- **DDoS Attack Simulation**: Allows users to simulate a DDoS attack and observe how metrics spike.
- **Mitigation Process**: Demonstrates how the system can reduce attack impact by activating protection measures.
- **Real-time Data Visualization**: Graphs and metrics are updated dynamically with simulated data.

### Proof of Concept
This dashboard uses **simulated data** for all metrics and is intended solely as a demonstration of potential DDoS detection and mitigation strategies.

### Live Demo

### Usage
- **Simulate Attack**: Click the "Simulate DDoS Attack" button to trigger the attack simulation.
- **Mitigate Attack**: Click "Activate DDoS Protection" to simulate attack mitigation and watch the metrics normalize.
